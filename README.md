# IGMtransfer

A code for calculating the transmission of Lyman α through the intergalactic medium, both for investigating the impact of the inter-/circumgalactic medium on the Lyman α spectral line, as well as probing the general transmission properties of the intergalactic medium. 

Installation, compilation, and use of the code is described in the file `Documentation.pdf`.

For a more in-depth description of the physics of the code, as well as its application to cosmological simulations, see [Laursen et al. (2011)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...728...52L/abstract).
